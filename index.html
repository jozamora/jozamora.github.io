	<br>
	<br>My name is Jesus Zamora and I was born in Acapulco, Mexico but I have been
	<br>living in the US since the age of 3. I attended Cal State Long Beach and 
	<br>I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I currently work for 
	<br>the Anaheim School District. 
	<br>I love traveling during my free time. I have visited 15 countries and I'm always
	<br>on the lookout to visit new ones.
